An opinionated framework for front-end architecture, using a lot of the currently hip tools like gulp, sass, react and browsersync.

My own personal "Let's try and make a boilerplate which isn't such an opinionated fuck" attempt. I've wanted something that I can actually modify, scale and build upon with ease, which is maintainable for multiple projects and written by multiple authors.

That means:
- No SCSS settings files with 200 pre-made variables for me to modify a button or a carousel
- A very limited use of fancy sassy bullshit such as calculations, functions or mixins in SCSS
- Logical react components, that work out of the box and are flexible in style
