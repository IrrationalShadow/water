<p>Brad Frost Clarity Conference 2016</p>

<p>style guide types</p>

<p>brand identity - logo, tagline, color, typography
voice &amp; tone - speak with a consistent tone of voice (mailchimp, the economist)
design language -  design principles, color, animation (material design)
code - bem, smacss, oocss, bigcommerce, airbnb - how to write code
ui pattern library - (bootstrap)</p>

<p>&ldquo;mood boards&rdquo; - inspiration collage of sites/apps
&ldquo;style tile&rdquo; - a collage of the colors/type/style. a general look/feel before high fidelity
&ldquo;component collage&rdquo; - sketch file with a bunch of elements + color palette together
All 3 of these things can come in discovery, and then FED&rsquo;s can dive straight
into early development and come up with basic (greyscale) coded concepts.
No need to wait for finished mocks in sketch/photoshop etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it official (Build it, Use it, Make it public - does help with recruitment)</li>
<li>Make it maintainable (Living pattern library - identical to live code - in sync. Eg. Rizzo)</li>
<li>Make it cross disciplinary (Product, Designers, FEDs, BEDs should be looking and consuming)</li>
<li>Make it agnostic (Patterns should not be named based on their content)</li>
<li>Make it contextual (Explain the components/constructs and how/when/why they should be used)</li>
<li>Make it last (Keep updating it. Release new versions, changelogs, blog posts, etc. PR&rsquo;s into Slack)</li>
</ul>

<p>create component/construct templates in HTML for either handlebars or react etc
namespace them with component or construct or layout.</p>

<p>Docs:
- In documentation include the components used in any given construct.</p>

<h2 id="show-the-types-variants-of-each-component-or-construct:ac21191b9b23b6a8d401d6fd20f51ca7">- Show the types/variants of each component or construct.</h2>

<p>atomic design - <a href="http://demo.patternlab.io/">http://demo.patternlab.io/</a></p>

<p>Notes on demo docs:</p>

<ul>
<li>tables are an atom</li>
<li>a simple &ldquo;by-line&rdquo; of text = a molecule. Why? It breaks his molecule definition of a &ldquo;group of atoms&rdquo;</li>
<li>blockquote + cite = molecule, not atom. Why? It&rsquo;s 2 fairly related elements.</li>
<li>blockquote without a cite = atom.</li>
<li>basic column grid classes = molecules.</li>
<li>a &ldquo;block&rdquo; component (basically a media component with variations) = molecule.</li>
<li>tabs, pagination, breadcrumbs = molecules.</li>
<li>primary nav = molecule.</li>
<li>search form, comment form = molecules.</li>
<li>individual comment = molecule.</li>
<li>organisms are fairly empty - header/footer are there, a useless HTML chunk that is apparently
an &ldquo;article body&rdquo; is an organism, as well as the full comment &ldquo;thread&rdquo;, which includes comment form +
comment molecules repeated + pagination for viewing comments. There&rsquo;s also recent tweets, related posts, and latest posts, which are all organisms - they&rsquo;re basically just a class with no styling wrapping repeated &ldquo;block&rdquo; molecules to make up the latest posts.
Basically, they&rsquo;re just molecules put together a certain way. Not much styling involved in any of them
besides the global header/footer.
Conclusion? Organisms only purpose seems to be that they&rsquo;re typically multiple molecules together.
No real logic outside of that to distinguish them from molecules. The global header/footer are the only
unique items, the remaining couple of items are just organised molecules.</li>
<li>templates are full pages with mock data. Header/Footer included in each one.
Conclusion? Content templates seem most useful here for browsing/searching. Header/Footer are already
organisms with there own pages in docs. Suppose it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to have them in the visual, but shouldn&rsquo;t
be included in the code snippets people will be looking for. Those should be based around the content of
the page.</li>
