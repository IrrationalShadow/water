<div class="media">
    <div class="media-content">
        <p>Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like water. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.</p>

        <p>Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like water. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.</p>

    <div class="media-content">
        <p>Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.</p>
