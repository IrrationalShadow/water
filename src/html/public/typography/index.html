<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Be water, my friend.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless. Like water. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;put water into a bottle&lt;/a&gt; and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not in this world to live up to your expectations and you're not in this world to live up to mine. Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.&lt;/p&gt;
